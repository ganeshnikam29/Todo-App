Simple Todo Application implemented :
   By using useState Hook,
   By using useContext Hook
   By using useReducer Hook,	
   By using Redux Toolkit 
   
When to use
useState Hook => Shape of State is simple and No multiple actions
useReducer Hook => Shape of State is complex and state have multiple actions
useContext Hook => State is simple and need to pass down in component tree without passing to every children of tree ( avoid props drilling)
Redux Toolkit => state is much more complex and need to managed centrally.
